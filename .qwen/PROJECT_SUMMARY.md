# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Set up a complete React Native project with the best tooling and practices for 2025, using Expo as the foundation.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Expo-based React Native project with TypeScript
- **Navigation**: React Navigation (stack, bottom-tabs, drawer) for routing
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with @reduxjs/toolkit
- **UI Components**: Custom component structure with theme system
- **Development Tools**: ESLint (with flat config), Prettier, Jest (with Expo preset)
- **Project Structure**: Organized by features (`/src/components`, `/src/screens`, `/src/navigation`, `/src/store`, `/src/theme`)
- **Key Dependencies**: `@react-navigation/*`, `react-redux`, `@reduxjs/toolkit`, `react-native-gesture-handler`, `react-native-reanimated`
- **Testing**: Jest with React Native Testing Library
- **Commands**: `npm start`, `npm run android`, `npm run ios`, `npm run web`, `npm run lint`, `npm run format`, `npm test`
